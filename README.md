## Description

This is a simple voice manipulation app.  You record your voice, and then play it back through various filters.  Want to sound like the bad guy from the most popular Sci-Fi movie series?  Now you can!

## Purpose
This app was written as my submission for the first project during my Udacity iOS Nanodegree course.  It was intended to learn how to use AutoLayout, passing information between view controllers, and acted as an introduction to AVFoundation.

## Feature Wish List

- 3D Touch support for iOS version
- Sound file storing and sharing
- Better editing controls
